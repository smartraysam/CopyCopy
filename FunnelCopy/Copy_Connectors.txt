A few examples of what you?ll discover?
A word of caution:
Add this to...
"After a time, as you continue to experience..."
After all...
Allow your self to drift back when you were a small child...
Allow yourself to be open such an imagine of...
Allow yourself to drift...
Allow yourself to imagine a scene of...
Allow yourself to travel in the future when...
"Also, ..."
"Although, ..."
Am I right about you so far?
"And as I implant theses words in your brain, you#39ll notice..."
"And as you absorb this information, you#39ll..."

"And as you are thinking about..., you become really interested."
And before long...
And best of all?
And can you remember...
And do you begin to notice...
And each morning you wake up you#39ll think...
And each night you go to bed you#39ll think...
And guess what?
And here?s some great news for you:
And I wonder if you#39ve already begun to notice the fact...
And I#39m sure you#39ve felt...
And in this same way...
And it begins to become easier to imagine...
And let me ask you a question...
And like I said:
And look at this:
And now you begin to realize...
And now you can ...
"And now, ..."
And remember?
And shortly...
And so your mind remembers what the feeling of....is like...
And soon you#39ll...
And that doesn#39t take into account the fact that?
And that?s just a small taste of what?s in store for you.
And that?s just the beginning...
And that?s just the start!
And that?s not all...
And that#39s just a small taste of what#39s in store for you.
And that#39s just the beginning...
And the longer you....the longer you...
And the result?
And this is just the tip of the iceberg.
"And to prove it, here is?"
And what if I could take...
And what?s worse?
And while we?re at it...
And yet you#39ve experienced that many times when...
And yet...
And you begin to notice...
And you can remember how...
And you will begin to...
And you will sink deeper and deeper...
And you will start to feel better and better about...
And you#39ll be surprised to discover...
And?

"And, as you listen to your mind, you can notice the feeling of. +
.."
"And, oh yes, let?s not forget..."
Anyhow?
Anyway...
Are we crazy?
Are you beginning to notice...
Are you beginning to see how...

"As a result of what I am telling you right now, you begin to fe +
el..."
As a result?
As each second passes?
As each sentence passes...
"As I communicate with you, you continue to..."
"As I said, ..."
"As I say, ..."
"As I talk to you , you continue to feel..."
"As long as you tell yourself, you..."
As more and more seconds pass by...
As time passes by...
As well as?

"As you allow yourself to go further and further down this page, +
 you#39re realizing..."

"As you allow yourself to scroll more and more down this page, y +
ou#39re..."
As you carefully scan each and every word of this page?
As you continue reading...
"As you continue to move down this page, you..."

As you continue to pay closer or closer attention to these words +
...

"As you keep reading this web page, you are feeling more and mor +
e..."
"As you keep scanning over this report, you are beginning to..."

"As you keep skimming through this article, you#39re beginning to+
think..."
As you may have noticed?
As you pay close attention to this page...
"As you probably remember, ..."
"As you read each word in this letter, ..."
"As you read on, I?ll tell you more about how..."

"As you read this article, think about certain words and their m +
eanings..."

"As you read this page, more and more, you will start to feel be +
tter and better about..."

"As you read this page, more and more, youll experience less and +
 less..."
As you recall the memory of...
As you sit and read this web page youve forgotten all about...
As you think about...
"As your brain responds to this information, you..."
As your brain.....
"As your read this page, you will experience the feeling of..."
As your view continues to expand...
As you#39re breathing...
"Aside from that, one thing#39s for sure"
Ask yourself this question...
"Astonishing, isn?t it?"
"At that moment, ..."
Back to the purpose of this letter.
Back to what I was saying...
"Bear with me, because I#39m going to show you how?"
"Before we go any further, I want to set something straight?"
"Believe me, ?"
"Best of all, ..."
"Best of all, ?"
Better yet...
Bottom line is?
"But before I jump into the details, let me say this?"
"But before we go into that, ..."
But better still...
But better yet...
But don?t get me wrong?
But don?t take my word for it...
But don#39t worry...
But even if you were to...
But first a warning:
But first a word of introduction?
"But first, let me give you..."
But here?s the most important part!
But how do you know if (Insert Your Product Name) is for you?
But I have an even better idea.
But I must let you in on a secret...
But I?m getting way ahead of myself.
But I?m jumping ahead. Let me tell you how this all came about:

"But if you#39re still not convinced, let me SWEETEN the deal for+
you..."
"But it doesn#39t stop there, either."
But just keep reading.
But let me go back to the beginning to continue the story...
But let?s suppose...
But make no mistake about it?
But more on that later?
But that#39s not all... Far from it!
But there is an irony in all of this.
But there is just one small catch...
But there?s a rub - and it?s really ironic.
But wait! You have seen nothing yet...
"But wait, it didn#39t stop there..."
But what if you could...
But you know what else?
But you#39re still unsure? You#39d rather be safe than sorry?
"But, ..."
"But, here?s a problem..."
"But, that?s only half the story..."
"But, there?s one more thing:"
By knowing this information...
"By now, you probably have some unanswered questions..."
"By now, you?re probably wondering..."
"By the way, ..."
Can this be true?
Can you imagine how great that feels?
Can you really afford not to?.
Consider this fact:
Consider this:
Could that be true?
Despite what you may have heard...
Do you follow me so far?
Do you qualify?
Do you remember a time when...
Does this make sense to you?
Don?t forget?
Don?t worry...
"Drift yourself back through time, before being..."
"Earlier on, I asked you the question..."
"Fact is, ..."
Fair enough?
"Finally, ?."
"First off, ..."
"First, ?."
"For all these reasons, ..."
For example:
For instance:
"For starters, ..."
"Frankly, ..."
Go forward in time when....
Hang on to your seat because?
Has this ever happened to you?
Have you heard enough?
Have you noticed yet that...
"Heck, ..."
"Heck, you don?t even need?"

I could go on and on...
I know you#39re feeling...
I know you#39re thinking...
"I know, you#39re probably skeptical. Right?"

"If you think it#39s nothing, think again?"
If you#39re like everyone else...
If you#39re like me...
If you#39re thinking...
I#39m not kidding?

Little by little you begin...
"Little by little, you become free of..."
Look at it this way...
Look at my next tip.
Look at the entire image of yourself...
Look no further.
"Look, ..."
Make no mistake:
"More about that later. For now, ..."
More details in a moment. But first?
More important than that?
"More on that in a moment - but first, let me show you"
"Moreover, ?"
"Most important of all, ..."
My point is:
My problem is your opportunity.
My strong hunch is?
"Needless to say, ?"
Notice how...

"Now, you?re probably wondering?"
"Of course,..."
"OK, I know what you?re thinking?"
"OK, I#39m nearly done, but?"
"OK, let me repeat that?"
OK. You might be asking?
"Okay, ?"
"Okay, you#39re probably thinking..."
"Okay, you#39re probably wondering..."
"On the other hand, ..."
One important caveat:
One more important point:

"Plus, ?"

Reality is?
Really think about...
Remember the feeling of...
